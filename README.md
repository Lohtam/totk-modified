# What is the point of this fork?
Marc Robledo's save editor was missing certain items that are found inside of the game. So I decided to add them in. Now, you may think I'm smart, but I'm actually not, Marc Robledo did a great job making the code very readable and easy to modify. Thanks, Marc Robledo! I only added the items into the lists, made some changes to my own tastes, and if you don't like them, sounds like a you problem. The most accurate description of this fork, however, is to provide a tool for glitch hunters to easily access certain items, for example, giant metal cage! No, seriously, a giant metal cage. It's decently heavy, who knows what it may be needed for.
I'm working on adding extra example files for the sake of those who may need a file to start from, it is working, just need to get the files.

# Issues
Pretty much the same as the original, again, go check it out, though there are some new ones as a result of my poor coding, some especially with when it comes to links.

# Anything Else?
You can contact me on discord, my tag is genericvideogamenpc. Feel free to suggeest any features that I can certainly try (emphasis on try,) to add. Or you can suggest any world objects to add to items list, since those, for some reason, work.

Trans Rights!
