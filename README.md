# TOTK Save Editor
Tears of the Kingdom save editor based on Marc Robledo's original save editor.
Check it out,
https://github.com/marcrobledo/savegame-editors
Additionally, I would like to thank Aquacluck for creating the save selection, it makes using the editor much easier!

# How can I use it?
You're going to need a modded Nintendo Switch or use an emulator like Yuzu (and alternatives) or Ryujinx.
ToTK uses .sav files which contain the player's main progress. caption.sav contains the thumbnail, and progress.sav contains all relevent save data. They're in slot_## folders, the ## being the number for the save file.
To determine what save is which, the caption in each slot folder corresponds to the save file, the caption being the picture showing in ToTK's load game menu.

There are two ways to load files into the editor:
1. Load the caption.sav or progress.sav individually
2. Load the slot folder or folder containing all slots. (thanks to Aquacluck again!)

This can be done by either clicking "Browse" or by dragging from your file browser into the box. The menu appropriate menus will appear. From there, feel free to make any edits to the file that you please. Once you are done, save the file and replace the original progress.sav!


# What is the point of this fork?
Marc Robledo's save editor was missing certain items that are found inside of the game. So I decided to add them in. Now, you may think I'm smart, but I'm actually not, Marc Robledo did a great job making the code very readable and easy to modify. Thanks, Marc Robledo! I only added the items into the lists and added some locale names, made some changes to my own tastes, and if you don't like them, sounds like a you problem.
I also changed the example save file to one at the start of GSI. I'm trying to figure out how to add other example files currently.

# Issues
Pretty much the same as the original, with some new ones when it comes to links.
