# What is the point of this fork?
Marc Robledo's save editor was missing certain items that are found inside of the game. So I decided to add them in. Now, you may think I'm smart, but I'm actually not, Marc Robledo did a great job making the code very readable and easy to modify. Thanks, Marc Robledo! I only added the items into the lists and added some locale names, made some changes to my own tastes, and if you don't like them, sounds like a you problem.
I also changed the example save file to one at the start of GSI. I'm trying to figure out how to add other example files currently.

# Issues
Pretty much the same as the original, with some new ones when it comes to links.
